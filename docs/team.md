## Director
### [Professor Washington Yotto Ochieng](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.ochieng)
Professor Washington Yotto Ochieng is the Head of the Centre for Transport Studies and Chair of Positioning and Navigation Systems in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Imperial College London. He is also the Director of the Imperial College Engineering Geomatics Group (ICEGG), and Fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation (FRIN) and the Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors (FInstCES). He is a Member of Council and Trustee of the Royal Institute of Navigation, Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers (MICE), the Institution of Highways and Transportation (MIHT), and the United States Institute of Navigation (MION). He sits on the International Editorial Boards of the GPS Solutions Journal, Journal of Geospatial Engineering and the Brazilian Journal of Cartographic Engineering. He is also an international member of the Canadian GEOIDE research network and assists a number of other national Research Councils with review of research proposals. He is an invited Member of the International Association of Geodesy’s Working Group on High Precision Positioning on Moving Platforms. 

Professor Ochieng has extensive experience in the design and application of navigation systems for multi-modal transport (land, sea and air) navigation, air traffic control and management (ATC/ATM) and transport telematics (intelligent transport systems), gained in industry and academia. After gaining a PhD degree in Space Geodesy at the University of Nottingham, he worked there as a Research Associate before moving to Racal Electronics (Thales) as Principal Engineer (Navigation specialist) where he participated in various international industrial consortia developing satellite navigation systems and products.  

Professor Ochieng is Principal Investigator on several EU, EC, EPSRC, Royal Society, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and government funded projects. Completed projects have included a survey of the data sources that could be used for the measurement of congestion (on behalf of the UK Department for Transport), the definition of robust algorithms for the integration of GNSS with dead reckoning sensors and map matching for transport telematics applications, the monitoring of integrity of GPS satellites, the design and definition of a verification strategy for the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the design of an architecture for a GNSS based system for asset management in urban areas, and definition of integrity algorithms for the Galileo system. Between 1995 and 1998, he was a member of the EGNOS System Engineering Core Team. He is a Consultant on navigation and positioning for many national and international organisations and has published widely in peer reviewed journals and conference proceedings. He has authored/co-authored over 130 papers and reports.
